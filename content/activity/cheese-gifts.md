We had a slim grocery budget, so we didn't buy expensive food.  We just never bought cheese.  After we paid off our debt, and I bought a block of cheese, I noticed and so did my son, who asked, "Dad, who gave you the present?", meaning the cheese.  I hear stories of people buying extravagant things with food stamps.  I like the feeling of this better: even in the life essentials and even when the standard of living around you encourages you to live just as high on that standard, taking control of your appetite and your budget and holding the line.
