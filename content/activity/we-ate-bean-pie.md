One of the most singularly dislike foods that we ate.  It was a pie pan full of refried beans with cornbread across the top.  It was as tasteless as it sounds.  We remember this meal the most as a thing we did to save money, and a thing we don't want to do now.  Funnily enough, however, we have revived it a couple of times to remember what the old days were like, and how fortunate we are.
