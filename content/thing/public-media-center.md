We very rarely bought books or movies.  We didn\'t fill up our Kindles -- we didn\'t have any.  We didn\'t fill up our bookshelves -- we had gotten a couple from Walmart.  We visited the library usually more than once a week.  We made a good habit out of it and still plough through many books with our children.  I still hear about a cool book someone\'s reading at work and jump on the Internet to place a hold for it at our library.  The library is amazingly willing to procure new titles that you request as well.  The same went for movies.  We very rarely went to the theatre.  We\'d hear about new movies and wait until their impending DVD release.  Then we\'d jump in the hold line for the library\'s copy and often wait about 6 months for the hot title.
