Since we had a few small children and just one car, we had to haul everyone around whenever mom *and* dad had somewhere to go.  When I went to work in the morning, I'd often take the car and leave it in the parking lot.  My wife would be at home all day without a car.  She usually said she didn't mind.  Obviously, she was a very good sport about it.  She walked a lot of places with the children.  If she did need it, she'd get to wake up when I woke up and drive me to work or the train station and then drive everyone else back home to eat breakfast in the early hours of the morning.
