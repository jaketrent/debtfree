A more extravagant (for us) trip would have been a trip to the Grand Canyon with extended family.  We'd never been there.  It seemed fun.  But the cost didn't fit in our aggressive "kill the debt" plan.  We told the family we wouldn't make it but hoped they'd have a good time.  I imagined a few eye rolls in response.  In the end, I hope they understood.  We met our goal, and I think they were eventually proud of us.
